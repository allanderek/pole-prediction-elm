# Development

To create the virtual environment run:
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate.fish 
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

If already created you only need the middle line:
$ source venv/bin/activate.fish 


## TODOS:

- [ ] Am I vulnerable to SQL-injection? See for example getting the leaderboard we just pass in the season.
- [ ] Fix the damn problem with devenv/direnv reloading
- [ ] Make a watcher for the front-end at least, and possibly the backend.
